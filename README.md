# CPR Checker

The CPR checker is a tool that can be used to aid online CPR training with ease. With an onboard accelerometer, magnetometer and load cell, data such as compressions per second, head inclination and compression depth is measured and processed by the Raspberry Pi, which is relayed onto an easy-to-access online tool to help healthcare practioners as well as students track performance and help guide their training.
